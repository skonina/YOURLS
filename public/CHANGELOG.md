Infinity-Squared CHANGELOG
==========================

1.5 (August 2013)
-----------------
Big changes:
* Internationalisation! See Wiki for instructions on how to use Infinity Squared in your language and translate it for other people to use.
* A proper CSS mobile interface. When I tried to add internationalisation, it quickly became apparent that having two code bases was stupid.

Bug fixes:
* HTML5 doctype
* Upgraded to qTip2
* Including jQuery and qTip from CDN
* No longer loading G+ code if it's not enabled
* Parallel loading of scripts thanks to Chrome's audits
* Rearranged the CSS so that it's more readable

Many thanks to [Ozh](http://ozh.org) for help with internationalisation

1.4 (February 2013)
-------------------
* Bookmarklets updated to the code relevant to YOURLS 1.6
* Added CSS animation to the main menu
* Updated jQuery to 1.9.1 (included with YOURLS 1.6)
* Updated qTipÂ² and Formalize.me so they're compatible with the new version of jQuery
* Added a few more comments to the code so it's easier to modify it
* Improved the readability of the documentation by moving over to Markdown
* Usual assortment of bug fixed, cleaned up code etc.

1.3 (August 2012)
-----------------
* Added a mobile version of the theme which can be disabled in the config file
* Discreet gradient in the menu
* New Google+ sharer
